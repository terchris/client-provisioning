# CLAUDE.md — Client Provisioning

**Start here:** Read [docs/ai-developer/README.md](docs/ai-developer/README.md) to get up to speed.

## Key rules

- **Always ask before starting** — ask whether to create a `PLAN-*.md` or `INVESTIGATE-*.md` before doing anything. Read [PLANS.md](docs/ai-developer/PLANS.md) before creating any plan file.
- **Ask before git commands** — always confirm before git add, commit, push, branch, or merge.
- **Every script must follow the standard** — see [rules/script-standard.md](docs/ai-developer/rules/script-standard.md) and [rules/bash.md](docs/ai-developer/rules/bash.md).
- **Validate before committing** — `bash docs/ai-developer/tools/validate-bash.sh` and `bash docs/ai-developer/tools/validate-powershell.sh`
